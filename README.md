# Future Sales Prediction with LSTM

## Project Description
This project aims to predict future sales using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to manage inventory, optimize supply chain operations, and plan future growth. By leveraging historical sales data, this model can provide reliable sales predictions, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Problem Statement
Sales forecasting is a common problem faced by businesses across various industries. Traditional statistical methods may not capture the complex patterns in sales data, especially when there are seasonal trends, promotions, or other factors affecting sales. This project addresses the need for a robust predictive model that can handle such complexities and provide accurate sales forecasts.

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create features that enhance the model's ability to learn patterns.
- **LSTM Model Building**: Construct and train an LSTM neural network.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Generate future sales predictions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
